for this assignment i found a couple of intersting things

only a few start and stop  stations were used most frequently

also a significantly larger number of rides and longer rides were taken on saturday and sunday

And even though there were over 1500 bikes some bikes had been used up to 800 times while a significant number had only been used under 50 times
